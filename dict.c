/*
 * A struct dict_name represents what Forth folks often call a "head" - a
 * name, its length, and a link to the previous head (in the same
 * vocabulary).
 *
 * Note that this definition does -not- include the code field. All of the
 * dictionary code - except for mu_find - deals only with these "pure"
 * names.
 *
 * The way that names are stored is a bit odd, but has -huge- advantages.
 * Many Forths store the link, then a byte-count-prefixed name, then
 * padding, then the code field and the rest of the body of the word. This
 * works fine when mapping from names to code fields (or bodies) - which is
 * what one does 97% of the time.
 *
 * But the other 3% of the time you're holding a code field address, or the
 * address of the body of a word, and you wonder, "What word does this
 * belong to? What's its name?" (Doing decompilation is a great example of
 * this, but not the only one.) This kind of "reverse mapping" is
 * impossible with the above "naive" dictionary layout. The problem: it's
 * impossible to reliably skip -backwards- over the name. The length byte
 * is at the -beginning- of the name, but the code field follows it.
 *
 * There are a couple of hacks that have been used. One (adopted by
 * fig-Forth) is to set the high bit of both the length byte and the last
 * byte of the name. This way one can skip backwards over the name, but
 * it's a slow scanning process, rather than an arithmetic one (subtracting
 * the length from a pointer).
 *
 * Another (ugly) hack is to put the length at -both- ends of the name.
 * This obviously makes it easy to skip over the name, forwards or
 * backwards.
 *
 * A much nicer solution is the move the link field -after- the name, and
 * forgo the prefix length entirely.  This is the solution that muFORTH
 * adopts (as dforth did before it).  Instead of -following- the link
 * field, the name -precedes- it, starting with padding, then the
 * characters of the name, then its length (one byte), followed directly by
 * the link. (The padding puts the link on a cell boundary.)
 *
 * Experienced C programmers will immediately notice a problem: structs
 * (such as the one we want to use to define the structure of dictionary
 * entries) cannot begin with a variable-length field. (In standard C they
 * cannot even -end- with variable-length fields - or that's my understand.
 * There are evil GCC-only workarounds, however.) So, what do we do? We'd
 * like to profitably use C's structs to help write readable and bug-free
 * code, but how?
 *
 * My solution is a bit weird, but it works rather well. Since I know that
 * there will be at least -one- cell (3 bytes and a length) of name (but
 * likely more), I will define a struct that represents only the last three
 * characters of the name, the length, and the link; the previous
 * characters are "off the map" as far as C is concerned, but there is an
 * easy way to address them. (To get to the beginning of a name, take the
 * address of the last three characters - suffix - add three and subtract
 * the length.)
 *
 * The only part of the code that seems a bit hackish is the calculation of
 * how many bytes to allocate for the name to put the link on a cell
 * boundary.
 *
 * One quirk of this method is that links no longer point to links, and
 * this forced me to restructure some code. In particular, .forth.  and
 * .compiler. (and all other vocab chains) are no longer simply
 * single-celled organisms (variables); they are now fully-fledged struct
 * name's. (One neat advantage to this is that it works well when chaining
 * vocabs together.)
